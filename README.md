  Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website. This project serves as a central hub to showcase my professional background, certifications, and technical projects. Currently in the process of updating for 2025.

## <a name="design"></a>🎨 Design

The website is designed with a modern, premium aesthetic focusing on **Glassmorphism**. Key design elements include:

- **Glass Effects**: translucent backgrounds with blur effects to create depth.
- **Responsive Layout**: A sidebar navigation that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Clean Typography**: Utilizes the 'Outfit' font family from Google Fonts for a professional and modern look.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clearly defined sections for About, Certifications, and Projects with card-based layouts for easy readability.

## <a name="technologies"></a>💻 Technologies

Vanilla web technologies to ensure performance and control without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

- **HTML5**: Uses semantic elements (`<main>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`) for accessible and structured content.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling including CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and CSS variables for consistent theming.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Handles the interactive elements, such as the tabbed navigation system that switches content views without page reloads.

## <a name="features"></a>✨ Features

- **Dynamic Navigation**: Single-page application feel with instant content switching.
- **Project Showcase**: A grid layout displaying featured projects with hover effects and direct links.
- **Certification Display**: A organized view of professional certifications.
- **Social Integration**: Easily accessible links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email.
